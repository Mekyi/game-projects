# Game projects (WIP)

The purpose of this repository is to list all of my public game projects in one place and make it easier to navigate to their source code and game pages. Most of my game projects can be found on [itch.io](https://mekyi.itch.io/). I will try to keep this list simple, so for more information about the projects, please their web page or repository.

> [!Note]
> Since GitHub markdown is not allowing `<iframe>` elements, this list is going to be implemented as GitHub pages at some point
