# Game projects (WIP)

**Notes: Since GitHub markdown is not allowing `<iframe>` elements in the repository README, this list is going to be implemented as GitHub pages**

The purpose of this list is to bring together and make it easier to find all of my public game projects I have worked on alone or in collaboration. Most of my game projects can be found on [itch.io](https://mekyi.itch.io/). I will try to keep the list simple, but more information about the projects can be found on their page or repository.
